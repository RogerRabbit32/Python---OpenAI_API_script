# Python - OpenAI API script


The following script opens a CSV file, runs reviews of the imaginary application taken from it through OpenAI API, which rates them on a scale of 1-10 based on the tone of the review.
The reviews are then being sorted based on the given rate and saved as a separate CSV file into the same directory. 


<b>To run the script on a local machine, one should:

<ul>
  <li>Download the code archive</li>
  <li>Open the code directory with an appropriate IDE</li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies with <code>pip install requirements.txt</code> command</li>
</ul>
</b>

<br>
The sample input file is presented within the code directory and is called 'Reviews.csv', however one could replace that file or data within the file with one of 
their own, preserving the file structure and format.
